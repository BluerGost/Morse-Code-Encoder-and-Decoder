#Morse-Code-Encoder-and-Decoder

KevinDecoderPlusEncoder.ino:
---------------------------------
It is the file which contains the auduino Sketch for the Morse Code encoder and decoder. Note this two will not work at the same time. 
If Pin 12 is High(+5V) -> it will operate in encoding mode.
If pin 12 is Low(0V) -> it will operate in decoding mode.

Circuit Diagram:
-----------------
Circuit Diagram Folder contains the circuit diagram image of this project.
This diagram was created using "Fritzing" tools. The file with the ".fzz" extention is the file actual circuit diagram editing file which can be opened with "Fritzing" software
